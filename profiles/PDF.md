###Overview:

The **Portable Document Format (PDF)** *(redundantly: PDF format)* is a file format developed by Adobe in the 1990s to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.Based on the PostScript language, each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, including the text, fonts, vector graphics, raster images and other information needed to display it. PDF was standardized as **ISO 32000** in 2008, and no longer requires any royalties for its implementation.

Today, PDF files may contain a variety of content besides flat text and graphics including logical structuring elements, interactive elements such as annotations and form-fields, layers, rich media (including video content) and three dimensional objects using *U3D* or *PRC*, and various other data formats.The PDF specification also provides for encryption and digital signatures, file attachments and metadata to enable workflows requiring these features. 

###History:
[Adobe Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.) made the PDF specification available free of charge in 1993. In the early years PDF was popular mainly in desktop publishing workflows, and competed with a variety of formats such as DjVu, Envoy, Common Ground Digital Paper, Farallon Replica and even Adobe's own PostScript format.

PDF was a proprietary format controlled by Adobe until it was released as an open standard on July 1, 2008, and published by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 32000-1:2008,[5][6] at which time control of the specification passed to an ISO Committee of volunteer industry experts. In 2008, Adobe published a Public Patent License to ISO 32000-1 granting royalty-free rights for all patents owned by Adobe that are necessary to make, use, sell, and distribute PDF compliant implementations.[7]

PDF 1.7, the sixth edition of the PDF specification that became ISO 32000-1, includes some proprietary technologies defined only by Adobe, such as [Adobe XML Forms Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFA) (XFA) and JavaScript extension for Acrobat, which are referenced by ISO 32000-1 as normative and indispensable for the full implementation of the ISO 32000-1 specification. These proprietary technologies are not standardized and their specification is published only on Adobeâ€™s website.[8][9][10][11][12] Many of them are also not supported by popular third-party implementations of PDF.

On July 28, 2017, ISO 32000-2:2017 (PDF 2.0) was published.[13] ISO 32000-2 does not include any proprietary technologies as normative references.

###Technical overview:
The PDF combines three technologies:


 - A subset of the PostScript page description programming language, for generating the layout and graphics.
 - A font-embedding/replacement system to allow fonts to travel with the documents.
 - A structured storage system to bundle these elements and any associated content into a single file, with data compression where appropriate.
