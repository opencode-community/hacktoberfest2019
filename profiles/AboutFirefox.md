###### Mozilla Firefox, or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla Corporation. Firefox is officially available for Windows 7 or newer, mac OS and Linux; its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD,OpenBSD,NetBSD,illumos and Solaris Unix.Its sibling, Firefox for Android, is also available. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.An additional version, Firefox for iOS ,was released on November 12, 2015. Due to platform restrictions, it uses the Webkit layout engine instead of Gecko, as with all other iOS web browsers.Firefox was created in 2002 under the codename "Phoenix" by the Mozilla community members who desired a standalone browser, rather than the Mozilla Application Suite bundle. During its beta phase, Firefox proved to be popular with its testers and was praised for its speed, security, and add-ons compared to Microsoft's then-dominant Internet Explorer 6. Firefox was released on November 9, 2004, and challenged Internet Explorer's dominance with 60 million downloads within nine months.Firefox is the spiritual successor of Netscape Navigator, as the Mozilla community was created by Netscape in 1998 before their acquisition by AOL.Firefox usage grew to a peak of 32.21% at the end of 2009,with version 3.5 overtaking Internet Explorer 7, although not all versions of Internet Explorer as a whole.Usage then declined in competition with Google Chrome.As of September 2019, Firefox has 9.52% usage share as a "desktop" browser, according to StatCounter, making it the second-most popular browser against Google Chrome with 71.15% (while share is exceptionally high in some countries where Firefox is most popular; up to over 75% share);usage share across all platforms is lower at 4.44% (third-most popular overall).According to Mozilla, in December 2014, there were half a billion Firefox users around the world.
## ** *FEATURES* **
Features include tabbed browsing, spell checking, incremental search, live bookmarking, Smart Bookmarks, a download manager, private browsing, location-aware browsing (also known as "geolocation") based on a Google service,and an integrated search system, which uses Google by default in most markets.Additionally, Firefox provides an environment for web developers in which they can use built-in tools, such as the Error Console or the DOM Inspector, or extensions, such as Firebug and more recently there has been an integration feature with Pocket. Firefox Hello was an implementation of WebRTC ,added in October 2014, which allows users of Firefox and other compatible systems to have a video call, with the extra feature of screen and file sharing by sending a link to each other. Firefox Hello was scheduled to be removed in September 2016.

Functions can be added through add-ons created by third-party developers. Add-ons are primarily coded using an HTML and JavaScript API known as WebExtensions, which is designed to be similar to the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge extension systems. Firefox previously supported add-ons using the XUL and XPCOM APIs, which allowed them to directly access and manipulate much of the browser's internal functionality. As they are not compatible with its multi-process architecture, XUL add-ons are now deemed Legacy add-ons and are no longer supported on Firefox 57 and newer.

Firefox can have themes added to it, which users can create or download from third parties to change the appearance of the browser. The Firefox add-on website also gives users the ability to add other applications such as games, ad-blockers, screenshot apps, and many other apps.
