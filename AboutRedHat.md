## RED HAT LINUX

### 1. Linux and Red Hat Linux: Are they the same? 
<hr>
*Red Hat* initially saw success supporting a **custom distribution of Linux**, then named *“Red Hat® Linux.”* <br>
The growth and reliability of *Red Hat Linux* made the two synonymous in many people’s minds. Since those early days, *Red Hat*’s solutions and technologies have built on this success to include nearly all aspects of the IT stack.

Red Hat **curates, secures, and supports a Linux distribution**—now known as *Red Hat Enterprise* Linux, a change that took place in 2003 as a result of merging with the Fedora Linux Project. Today, *Red Hat* Enterprise Linux supports and powers software and technologies for automation, cloud, containers, middleware, storage, application development, microservices, virtualization, management, and more.

Linux plays a major role as the core of many of Red Hat’s offerings. It’s far beyond simply being an operating systems for servers—Linux is the foundation for the modern IT stack.

#### 2.2. Deeper Dive: Technicalities of Red Hat
Being a Linux distribution, *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* contains the Linux kernel as well as some applications for performing certain tasks. Like all Linux distributions, RHEL is **open source**. Thus, people can view its source code, download it and make their own customized versions.
<br> <br>
A typical RHEL distribution would include development tools, applications, services and utilities. <br>
Compiz, CUPS, DHCP, Firefox, GIMP, MySQL, OpenOffice.org, Samba, and Python.

**QUICK FACT:** <br>
*Red Hat* was one of the first companies to realize that "free" software could be sold as a product. <BR>
