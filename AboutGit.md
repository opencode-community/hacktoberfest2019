## About Git

Git is a distributed version-control system.

It is used to track changes in source code during development of the software.Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows and therefore it is the most widely used modern version control system in the world.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.

Junio Hamano is the current maintainer of Git since 2005.

Git's design was inspired by BitKeeper and Monotone. Git was originally designed as a low-level version-control system engine, on top of which others could write front ends, such as Cogito or StGIT

It is a free and open-source software and is available for Linux, Mac & Windows operating systems.

* Branching and merging becomes easier
* Data integrity
* Distributed model
* Security
* Flexibility

> ## Some commands of Git:

* git config

( The git config command is a convenience function that is used to set Git configuration values on a global or local project level.)

* git init

(The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository.)

* git clone

(The git clone command downloads an existing Git repository to your local computer. You will then have a full-blown, local version of that Git repo and can start working on the project.)

* git add

(The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.)

git commit

( The git commit command is used to save your changes to the local repository.)

* git diff

( The git diff is a multi-use Git command that when executed runs a diff function on Git data sources.)

* git reset

(The git reset is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo)

* git status

(The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.)

* git checkout

(The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch.)

* git branch

(The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches.)

* git merge

( The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.)

* git push

(The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. )
