Garbage is bascally that memory which remains unused for a long time. 

Either the garbage has to be automatically cleaned so that there is space in the memory for creating new variables and allocating memory to them or it may be done explicitly.

In Java, garbage collection occurs automatically and it can be done explicitly also using finalize().

Garbage collection is a process which occurs after a fixed time and all the previously allocated unused memory areas are freed.
This is mainly the garbage collection in java and many other languages.
