# About Tmux
tmux is a terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. It is useful for running more than one command-line program at the same time. It can also be used to detach processes from their controlling terminals, allowing SSH sessions to remain active without being visible.

# Features
tmux includes most features of GNU Screen. It allows users to start a terminal session with clients that are not bound to a specific physical or virtual console; multiple terminal sessions can be created within a single terminal session and then freely rebound from one virtual console to another, and each session can have several connected clients. Some Tmux notable features are
* Menus for interactive selection of running sessions, windows or clients
* Window can be linked to an arbitrary number of sessions
* vi-like or Emacs command mode (with auto completion) for managing tmux
* Lack of built-in serial and telnet clients (which some consider bloat for the terminal multiplexer)
* Easier configuration
* Different command keysâ€”it is not a drop-in replacement for screen, but can be configured to use compatible keybindings
* Vertical and horizontal Window split support
