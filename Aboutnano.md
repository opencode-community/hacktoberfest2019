**GNU nano** is a text editor for **Unix-like computing systems** or **operating environments** using a command line interface. 
It emulates the **Pico text editor**, part of the Pine email client, and also provides additional functionality.
Unlike Pico, nano is licensed under the **GNU General Public License** (GPL).
Released as free software by *Chris Allegretta* in 1999, nano became part of the GNU Project in 2001

When getting used to the command-line, Linux novices are often put off by other, more advanced text editors such as *vim* and *emacs*. While they are excellent programs, they do have a bit of a learning curve. 
Enter Nano, an easy-to-use text editor that proves itself versatile and simple. **Nano** is installed by default in **Ubuntu** and many other **Linux distros** and works well in conjunction with *sudo*, which is why we love it so much.

The strength of nano lies in its **simplicity** of use. The shortcuts work just like in GUI-based word processors like Word and Open Office, so it’s just a matter of learning which ones do what. 
Everything outside of that is just simple text-editing. Next time you have to edit stuff on the command-line, we hope that you’ll be more comfortable with it now that you’ve gotten familiar with nano.
